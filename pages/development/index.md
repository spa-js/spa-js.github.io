# Development and Debugging

## Introduction

This document details the best practices associated with development and debugging applications.

- [HTML](./html.html)
- [JavaScript](./javascript.html)
- [CSS](./css.html)
- [Images](./images.html)
- [Responseive Design](./responsive-design.html)
- [Testing](./testing.html)
- [Accessibilityy](./accessibility.html)
- [Globalization](./globalization.html)


## Clean Coding
Writing clean and maintainable code should be a priority for every developer. Sloppy programming practices is unprofessional, and shows disdain for your fellow programmers.

- Coding Style guides
	- Spacing and indentation
- logging
- comments
- Directory and file names

- ALWAYS write to the latest standards (HTML5, CSS3, EMCA Script 5).
	- This will keep you safe
	- Use shim toolkits to bolster older browsers.


## Linting

- [JSLint](http://jslint.com/) - The grandfather of JavaScript lint tools by Doug Crockford. Read the instructions. Please.
- [JSHint](http://jshint.com/) - A popular fork of the original JSLint.
- [ESHint](https://github.com/nzakas/eslint) - A command line JS linter that enables a plugable list of tests. It shows promise as its more flexible than JSHint
- [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/)jshint.com

See the [Web Coding Checklist](./web_coding_checklist.html) for general guidance on code reviews.


## Scaffolding
Scaffolding is a good way to get started with a new development project.
It provides a template and some times prompts the user to be able customized the template.
Some project provides templates for different stages of development from unit testing to mobile development.
When getting started with a new technology or framework is sometimes difficult to users look for a fast way
to get a basic "Hello World" project created.
These scaffolding templates are usually created in the open collaboration by experts on the technology and
try to embed best practices that they them selfs learned over time and want to help others not make again.

Some templates cover basic web apps like putting html, css, and js together to more complex project like
dojo builds with integration into hybrid Apps.
