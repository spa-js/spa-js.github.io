Introduction
-------------

You are encouraged to submit content to this site! We aim to represent as many different views and expertise as possible. Generally, if you feel there are areas we have not properly addressed, or if a topic is not addressed for a specific toolkit or environment, then make your voice heard.

We cannot pretend to be experts in all possible solutions. We do want thoughtful contributions that are generally shareable and represent clean concepts.

Submitting New Assets
---------------------
Assets should be submitted as follows:

1. Download the standard submission [template][template].

	- You are free to adjust it as needed to meet your needs, but please provide all *required* information.
2. Create a new [GitHub issue][issue] for the spas-js project.
3. Provide a short title of the asset and either
	- Attach your completed submission document
	- Copy and paste the contents directly into the new issue form
4. Optionally, add a label indicating the type of submission

We reserve the right to edit submissions for readability, but we will work with you if there are contextual changes required.
