## Introduction
In the following section, we'll list general areas, and what we think are the top toolkit providers. We wont recommend specific toolkits, as we'll that to you to find solutions that work for you and your projects requirements.

- [JQuery](./jquery.html)
- [Dojo Toolkit](./dojo.html)
- [AngularJS](./angular.html)
- [Backbone](./backbone.html)
- [Polymer](./polymer.html)


## Other Toolkits worth investigating
The list of other options is far to long to provide here, but a couple popular and established toolkits include:

- [Modrnizer](http://modernizr.com/) is another toolkit focused on leveling the playing field and attempting to bring a common API to all browsers.  It is quite popular and does its job well.

- [SemanticJS](http://semantic-ui.com/) is another new toolkit that contains a nice and clean implementation for layouts and common widget.

- [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) - provides a simple layer that provides a consistent basic JS API across all browsers. This is a bare bones, no frills toolkit, but is very effective and fast. This library should be considered as a minimum solution to any web app.  It is also frequently dependents for many other libraries.

- [Lowdash](http://lodash.com/) - Is a variation of the Underscore implementation and it is gaining popularity over underscore and some of its legacy backage.

- [ExtJS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) - Sencha's entry.
- [YUI](http://yuilibrary.com/) - Yahoo's toolkit that comes with a very nice set of widgets
- [MooTools](http://mootools.net/)
