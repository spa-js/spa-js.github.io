## Introduction

Continuous integration (CI) should be one of the first tasks of any development project. It is typically saved as a task to complete towards the end of a projects development. There should never be a human intervention during the build/test/deployment of the application. This should be repeatable at any time, and on regular schedules.
There is no excuse for any surprises during a build. This is especially true of a production build.

There are many tools that assist in CI. These range from the host centric **ANT**, **Maven**, and **Hudson**  build tools, to modern day solutions such as **Yeoman** (Yo, Grunt, Bower), and even custom Node scripts.
Find the tool(s) that work for your environment and use them.


## Package Management (Dependencies)

### NPM
Node Package Manager (NPM), which is part of NodeJS, provides a clean and organized way to publish application modules that have fixed dependencies.

### Bower (http://bower.io)


## Automation

### GruntJS (http://gruntjs.com)

### Minified/ Compress

### Builds


### The Intern
[Intern](http://theintern.io/) is the latest creation from the SitePen Labs, born out of the need to streamline the process of testing applications. You can run tests using the browser or node.js and seamlessly integrate with [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) or [Selenium](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/Grid2). Continuous integration with Travis CI support. Write tests using object, TDD, or BDD styles and full code coverage reporting with Istanbul.

## Cloud Testing

### Sauce Labs
[Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/) is a cloud based test environment for desktop and mobile browsers

### Heroku
[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is a cloud based testing environment that integrates with GitHub and supports many common server side languages.

### Travis CI
[Travis CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/) is a hosted continuous integration service for the open source community.




## Scaffolding
Scaffolding is a good way to get started with a new development project.
It provides a template and some times prompts the user to be able customized the template.
Some project provides templates for different stages of development from unit testing to mobile development.
When getting started with a new technology or framework is sometimes difficult to users look for a fast way
to get a basic "Hello World" project created.
These scaffolding templates are usually created in the open collaboration by experts on the technology and
try to embed best practices that they them selfs learned over time and want to help others not make again.

Some templates cover basic web apps like putting html, css, and js together to more complex project like
dojo builds with integration into hybrid Apps.
