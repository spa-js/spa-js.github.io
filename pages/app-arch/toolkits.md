## Base Toolkit(s)
The best advice that can be given is "Why reinvent the wheel, when so many others have already done it for you."  There is a wealth of JavaScript toolkits that can have an enormous impact on the quality of your app. In fact it is unheard of to attempt any medium to large scale Web app without utilizing a base toolkit. The most popular general purpose toolkit is [JQuery](http://jquery.com/). JQuery, long with literally dozens of similar toolkits provide a rich API for developing web apps. Other more specialized toolkits focus on specific requirements of an app. In the following section, we'll list general areas, and what we think are the top toolkit providers. We wont recommend specific toolkits, as we'll that to you to find solutions that work for you and your projects requirements.

As standards advance, a lot of functionality of toolkits will diminish.  We still feel there will always be a place for quality toolkits to reduce boilerplate code and general application scaffolding.

### General purpose Toolkits
The following toolkits are focused on providing a robust platform for developing web applications.
- [JQuery](http://jquery.com/), [JQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/) - These are the de facto standards in JavaScript toolkits. There are an overwhelming number of extensions available to extend JQ's functionality. JQ is known for being easy to learn, but may have scalability concerns for larger projects.
- [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/) - Dojo provides a comprehensive environment for large scale web apps. It does have a larger learning curve, but has proven to be a scalable and flexible environment for large enterprise grade web apps.
