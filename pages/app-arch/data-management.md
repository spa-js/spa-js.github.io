# Data Management

## Introduction

![SPA layered environment](./images/app-arch-layers.png)


Data drives almost all apps. Balancing access to current data, versus performance is critical to a successful user experience. Sometimes we don't have a choice.

- Data contracts
- Course vs fine grained data access
- Service calls fail, deal with it! (or dont)
- Get only what you need
- Formats XML v JSON
- Transcoding
- Storage issues (caching, session, encryption, size, etc)
